# Worked Example: Re-architecting a Multi-Lens Review Panel

Load this file when designing any multi-lens module (panel, audit,
multi-perspective critique). It walks through one real
re-architecture using the design discipline.

## The starting design (anti-pattern)

A "review panel" runs 5 mandatory specialist lenses + 1 conditional
specialist + 1 arbiter, all inside ONE thread. The thread loads each
persona file in turn, plays each lens, accumulates findings in
working notes, then loads the arbiter persona and synthesizes a
single output comment.

### Why it is wrong (durable-truth analysis)

Truth #1: context is finite and fragile.
- By the time the arbiter step runs, the thread's window contains:
  the orchestrator wrapper + 5 personas' text + 5 sets of findings
  + the conditional persona text + the arbiter persona + the
  template. The first persona's text is now far from focus, and
  its lens's nuances have decayed influence on the synthesis.

Truth #2: context must be explicit.
- The lenses cannot operate independently: each lens reads the
  prior lenses' findings whether the design wants that or not,
  because all share the window. That cross-pollination corrupts
  the "independent specialist" contract the design claims.

Truth #3: output is probabilistic.
- The variance is highest exactly where the design demands the
  most precision: the arbiter's synthesis runs at the deepest
  point of attention degradation.

Classic-principle analysis:
- SHARED MUTABLE STATE: all lenses write to the same window.
- CONTEXT THRASH: one thread plays >=5 distinct lenses.
- UNREACHED ESCAPE HATCH: textbook fan-out (>=3 independent
  lenses, no shared state) executed as single-loop.

## The redesigned shape (FAN-OUT + SYNTHESIZER realizing PANEL)

```

Each lens gets its own thread with its own fresh context window.
The parent (orchestrator) is the only writer to the output sink.

```

## Why each thread loads only ITS persona

This is the key disambiguation. The Architect THREAD is a runtime
spawn (fresh context window). At startup, that thread loads the
Architect PERSONA (a markdown file used as a scoping prompt). The
persona is not a thread; the thread is not the persona. The thread
exists because we need fresh context; the persona exists because
we need a focused lens. They cooperate.

The arbiter thread is the only one that loads multiple inputs:
it loads the arbiter persona AND the findings from each lens
(passed as text). It does NOT load the lenses' personas; that
would defeat the purpose of having run them in separate threads.

## SoC and dependency check

- Each lens persona = one Single Responsibility (one specialist
  domain).
- The orchestrator skill DEPENDS ON each persona via link; it does
  not inline persona content. Composition over inheritance.
- The arbiter is a distinct persona (not the orchestrator wearing
  a hat). Single Responsibility.

## Compliance summary

| Check | Old design | New design |
|---|---|---|
| Reduced Scope (per-lens fresh window) | FAIL | PASS |
| Orchestrated Composition (independent contracts) | FAIL | PASS |
| Single-writer interlock on output | PASS | PASS |
| God module avoidance | FAIL (one thread = many lenses) | PASS |
| Fan-out where applicable | FAIL | PASS |

## Handoff packet shape (template)

When you produce a real design, output a packet that looks like:

```
## Design: <module name>

### Component diagram
<flowchart>

### Thread / sequence diagram
<sequenceDiagram>

### Interface sketches
- <module>: trigger=<...>, inputs=<...>, outputs=<...>, depends=[<links>]
- ...

### Declared targets
common-only | <list of harnesses (justify each)>

### Open findings
- <severity>: <finding>
```

The coder thread takes this packet and proceeds to step 7
(portability check, then natural-language drafting).
